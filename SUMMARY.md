## Summary: Methodology, Insights & Strategy Recommendations
### Methodology
Trades were enriched with daily market sentiment data and aggregated at an
account-date level. Performance and behavioral metrics were compared across
Fear and Greed regimes. Trader segmentation was performed based on activity
levels and directional bias. A baseline predictive model was built as a bonus.

### Key Insights
- Traders tend to trade more aggressively during Greed periods but with lower consistency
- Fear regimes are associated with reduced activity and more conservative behavior
- High-frequency traders experience higher volatility in returns

### Strategy Recommendations
- Risk limits should be tightened during Greed regimes to control overtrading
- Sentiment-aware strategies can help identify periods of elevated risk
- Monitoring trader behavior patterns can improve performance stability
